A random sample of these transfers will be provided, and the report will indicate the order in which they were selected. The size of the sample will be determined in a statistically valid manner depending on the total number of transfers for the facility or the size of the sample will be specified by the user. This report will exclude all transfers to the four character holding of discharge areas associated with normal operational or accidental loss or measured discard activity.
