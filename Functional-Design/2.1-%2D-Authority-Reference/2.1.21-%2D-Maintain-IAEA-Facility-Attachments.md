Provides an end-user interface for the data maintenance of facility attachment information.

**Use Case(s)**

- UC1.1 - The Nuclear Materials Analyst maintains the Authority Reference static data by adding, updating, and/or deleting data records.

**System Requirement(s)**

AUSCR21 - The NMMSS users shall have the capability to manually enter, edit, and search for facility attachment information. The following information will be included for facility attachments: RIS, NMMSS composition code, IAEA composition code, facility composition code, IAEA composition code description, material type, material type valid-as-of date, material type valid-through date, IAEA applicability code, IAEA applicability code valid-as-of date, IAEA applicability code valid-through date, key measurement point, key measurement point valid-as-of date, key measurement point valid-through date, measurement method, measurement method valid-as-of date, and measurement method valid-through date.
